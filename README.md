Convolet - Chat-based AI workflow framework

## Why convolet?

Convolet is a lightweight framework for you to build chat-based AI workflows.
Basically, it lets you define a workflow with a set of steps organized in a
directional graph structure. Each step can be an AI generated question to prompt
user for an answer, or an AI-evaluated decision to generate structured output data.
